What is this?
-------------
	These scripts obtain data from Diablo's dfeedinfo output, store
	them in an RRD database, and show detailed graphs for infeed and
	outfeed peers in Diablo.  For a sample of what this outputs, visi
	http://newsfeed.visi.com/stats/.

Prerequisites
-------------
	py-rrdtool - FreeBSD port (/usr/ports/net/py-rrdtool_lgpl) or
		website http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-rrdtool/

stats.py
--------
	Configuration:

		FEEDINFOCMD = '/news/dbin/dfeedinfo -i -o -r'
		DATADIRECTORY = '/home/kpettijohn/stats/data'

		FEEDINFOCMD - Command to Diablo's dfeedinfo, which will display
			incoming and outgoing raw data.  The data MUST be raw, and
			not formatted in MB/GB/TB...
		DATADIRECTORY - The directory where the RRD files will be
			kept.  Create this directory, as well as INFEED and
			OUTFEED subdirectories underneath them.

			mkdir /home/kpettijohn/stats/data/{,INFEED,OUTFEED}

		Set up a cronjob to run this script every 5 minutes.

		*/5 * * * *             /home/kpettijohn/stats/getdata.py

index.py
--------
	This file is what your webserver will execute as a CGI script.
	Rename it if you wish or desire.  Ensure your web server can
	execute it as a CGI script.

	Configuration:

		DATADIRECTORY = '/home/kpettijohn/stats/data'
		IMAGEDIRECTORY = '/news/www/stats/images'
		IMAGEREF = '/stats/images'
		SITEREF = '/stats/'
		GRAPHLENGTH = '24 hours'
		INDEXTITLE = 'VISI.com Transit Server Graphs'
		BACK_URL = 'http://noc.visi.com/'
		BACK_TEXT = 'Back to VISI.com NOC'

		DATADIRECTORY - The directory where the RRD data files are
			kept.  This should match the DATADIRECTORY variable
			in stats.py.
		IMAGEDIRECTORY - Where the script will generate images
			when the webserver executes it.  Ensure this directory
			is writeable by the user that the webserver will run
			this script as.
		IMAGEREF - This is prefixed to the file name in the <IMG SRC="">
			so the HTML output by the script directs browsers to the
			proper place to grab the image that was just created.
		SITEREF - The URL used in reference with the "Go Back..." link
			displayed at the top of the page.  This should link to
			this CGI script.
		GRAPHLENGTH - The default timespan of graphs if a value is
			not obtained from form values by the script.
		INDEXTITLE - The title of the page to be displayed
		BACK_URL - The URL that BACK_TEST (below) referrs to
		BACK_TEXT - The text for the URL above.
