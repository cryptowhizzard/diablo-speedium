For some bizarre reason, I wanted to be able to collect Path lines for
the news path survey.  I use the following program and hourly script
to do so in a relatively efficient way.  (Obviously, it would be best
if there were an option to Diablo to log Path lines somewhere, but
this seems to be the best that can be done without changing the daemon
itself.)  Of course, it's a real horrid, unportable hack, but it does
work and I'm hoping that it will serve as inspiration to somebody...
