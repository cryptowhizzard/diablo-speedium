diablo-inpaths.pl v1.0  Iain Lea  iain@ecrc.de  970824
------------------------------------------------------

This script allows you to collect Path: header infomation from
a DIABLO news relay system.  It scans the /news/spool/news dir
and logs the results by default to /var/log/news/path.log

diablo-inpaths -h  gets you an help page of cmd line options.

Use the driver script diablo-inpaths.sh by setting the values
at the top of the script to your site values and run from a
cronjob every couple of hours or once a day depending on how
large your spool is and how fast news is expired at your site.

Comments and code patches appreciated.

Enjoy
