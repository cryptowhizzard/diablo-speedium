This is a quick little program I wrote one night when I changed my
diablo.config:spooldirs directive from 8 to 9.  We had retired the
RAID controller on an array, giving me some extra disks, and I wanted
to use the space for articles.  (yes, the details of what happened
are more gory and complex, but basically I wound up with N.00..N.07
in a filled state and N.08 not).

PLEASE NOTE that the new setting for spooldirs must be compiled into
this program, see the #define near the top.

Example usage:

% cd /news/spool/news
% find N* -name 'D.*' -print | fixup > /tmp/out

will generate a list in /tmp/out of dirs that need to be moved, and
of already-correctly-placed dirs.

You can then do something like

% grep "mv N." /tmp/out | sh -x

or maybe

% foreach i (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
> grep "mv N.0${i}" /tmp/out | sh -x&
> end

to actually move the stuff around, as long as your system handles moving
of directories across filesystems properly.

This will take a while to run.  It took about six hours to move 324GB of
data around as needed.
