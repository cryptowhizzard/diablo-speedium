This is old.  This worked then and it may not work now.  It's here for
historical reference.

Diablo now has the ability to use things like compressed spools and this
absolutely will not work with that, as-is.

The code is pathetically simple.  It should be easy to work with.  If
anybody is seriously looking to use this code, you might want to talk to
me first.

A more comprehensive (and somewhat more system-intensive) way to do this
would be to use a NNTP-to-UUCP conversion program.  It would be very easy
to code one up, but I've not yet done it.  If anyone desperately needs
one, drop me a line and a little money and it can be yours.  :-)
