Joe's UUCP Batcher for Diablo

"It works - maybe." -JG

I had a need to do UUCP batching under Diablo.  This is what I use.  It
is very simple, and doesn't have a lot of options.

There are some decisions wired into the code:

batcher.c places a limit of 2MB on uncompressed batch sizes.

send-uucp places a limit of 15 batches on the queue size.  It
assumes that "uustat -ssystem" returns one line per queue entry.
It does not make allowances for other types of traffic, such as
e-mail, so it would need some improvements for that kind of
use.

send-uucp uses gzip -9.

There's probably some other assumptions.  The code should be
easy enough to read and to fix.

Basically, it is minimalist code that did what I needed.  If it
doesn't do what you need, fix it.  :-)
