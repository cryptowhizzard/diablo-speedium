/*
 * This is the long-awaited rewrite of the ugly hashfeed system I wrote so
 * long ago for Diablo as a way to distribute articles between two spool
 * servers in a deterministic fashion.
 *
 * The old hashfeed was never intended to do more than two spool servers,
 * and used a trivial summation-of-MID algorithm (see "quickhash" funct)
 * to generate a hash.  This worked fine for load balancing between two
 * servers, but never should have seen daylight in the mainline Diablo
 * distribution, where people are feeling the pain of my shortsightedness.
 * The algorithm works vaguely well for hash mod values up to perhaps 100,
 * but it is not cryptographic in nature and is subject to trivial funnel
 * behaviours.  On average, though, it is "okay".
 *
 * Further, we have seen interesting applications of the functionality that
 * go far beyond what was originally envisioned or intended.  For example,
 * distributing articles onto spool disks based on hash in order to
 * guarantee that the same disks on redundant spool servers contain the same
 * set of articles.  However, this has its problems:  due to the limits of
 * the old implementation, it would be very difficult to leverage that sort
 * of capability while simultaneously being able to deterministically
 * retrieve articles from one of N servers.
 *
 * The new hashfeed has been designed from the ground up to allow for much
 * expanded functionality.  It uses a cryptographic MD5 hash of the
 * Message-ID as a data source, and can take 32-bit values from that value
 * for various uses.  This allows up to four completely independent hash
 * values to be derived from a single Message-ID, with a full 32-bit range
 * for each.  It also allows for the specification of multiple ranges, and
 * other similarly useful stuff.
