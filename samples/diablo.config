#	options file version.  The file must begin with a version command.
#	It then contains options related to that version.  The file may then
#	optionally contain another version command and options related to THAT
#	version.  Diablo will ignore options for versions greater then the
#	code scanning the options file.  This allows diablo to report parsing
#	errors in a forward & backwards compatible manner.

# hash	METHOD[/COMPATIBLE-METHOD]
# hash	prime		<--- original hash method
# hash	crc/prime	<--- recommended when switching from prime
# hash  crc		<--- recommended after stabilized with crc or w/ new
#			     installation
#
#	Specify the hash method.  'prime' is the original hash method.  The new
#	hash method is 'crc'.  The new crc method generates fewer collisions
#	and is recommended.
#
#	You can have diablo fallback to an older hash method if a lookup using
#	the new method fails.  This is only used when migrating from one hash
#	method to another and CAUSES DIABLO TO MAKE TWICE AS MANY HISTORY 
#	LOOKUPS!  The suggestion is that you set it to 'crc/prime' when
#	upgrading from diablo 1.13 or older.  After a week or two of operation
#	you should then set it to just 'crc' and restart diablo.
#
#	WARNING!  changing the hash method will blow away the diablo reader 
#	stuff and (usually) blow away the feeder's history file, so don't mess
#	with it unless you know what you are doing.
#
hash	crc

# hsize	1m/2m/4m/8m/16m/.../512m	('k' or 'm' only)
#
#	Hash table size, in entries.  The default is 4 million entries (16MB).
#	The hash table is chained so you can't run out, but a smaller hash 
#	table will result in more chain links and less efficient operation.
#	The value must be a power of 2 and is very dependent on the
#	capabilities of the OS - many can't handle more than 256m due to
#	limitations with mmap().
#
#	This option can be changed on the fly, the next biweekly admin will
#	resize the hash table.  Note that the -h option to diload will override
#	this setting just as this setting will override any compiled default.
hsize	4m

# active on/off
# activedrop on/off
#
#	Turn on or off dactive.kp based Xref generation in the diablo feeder.
#	The default is off.   Turning this option on will cause diablo to
#	assign article numbers for those groups found in dactive.kp.  The NX
#	field (alternate ending-article-number) in dactive.kp will be updated
#	appropriately.  If slave mode is off, Xref: headers will be generated
#	based on the updated NX field for a group in dactive.kp.
#
#	activedrop defaults to off.  The diablo feeder normally spools 
#	articles even if none of the article's groups can be found in the
#	active file.  If activedrop is set to "on", the diablo feeder will
#	drop such articles.
#
#	If you specify an absolute path instead of "on", you turn on active 
#	and override path_server_dactive.  This feature is depreciated in
#	favor of the path_server_dactive mechanism and should no longer be 
#	used.
#
#	Please see the manual page for 'diablo-files', 'dkp' and 'diablo-kp' 
#	for reference.
#
#	--
#
#	If you use the active file feature on the feeder side it is usually
#	in order to generate master article reference numbers for one or more
#	readers via Xref:.  In this case you typically want to leave the
#	server-side slave mode off (slave off), and you typically want to
#	start the diablo reader side (dreaderd) with the '-x masterhostname'
#	option.
#
#	NOTE!  dreaderd is responsible for updating the NB and NE fields
#	for a group in dactive.kp, where NE is the primary ending article
#	number in the group.  When acting as a master the Diablo server
#	will update the NX field, allowing it to operate on the same dactive.kp
#	file as a dreaderd running on the same host.  It is not appropriate
#	for the diablo server to update NE because that would result in 
#	incorrect output from the 'group' and 'list active' commands, possibly
#	reporting the existance of articles not yet placed in overview.  This
#	is why the diablo server updates NX.  When synchronizing your active
#	file to a remote host with the dsyncgroups commands, pay special
#	attention to the -X and -XX options to dsyncgroups.
#	
active	off
activedrop off

# feederxrefslave on/off
# slave on/off	(This is the old option now replaced with feederxrefslave)
#
#	Turn on or off Xref: slave mode.  The default is off, which causes
#	Diablo to strip incoming Xref: headers and, if active is on, 
#	generate it's own Xref: headers.
#
#	If slave mode is on Diablo will not strip incoming Xref: headers and
#	will NOT generate it's own.
#
feederxrefslave off

# feederxrefsync on/off
#
#	If feederxrefslave is on and active is on, then sync our active NX
#	field (end article number) for each newsgroup in the Xref: line if
#	one exists in the article.
#
# feederxrefsync off

# feederxrefhost hostname
#
#	Specify the Xref: hostname to be used when creating Xref: lines
#	This defaults to the pathhost
#
# feederxrefhost host.example.com

# maxconnect N
# maxconnect 15
#
#	Specify the maximum number of parallel connections per connecting IP.
#	This is an overall maximum.  The maxconnect field in dnewsfeeds must
#	be less then this parameter to override it.
#
#       IF DREADERD CONNECTS TO THIS DIABLO, USE A LARGE MAXCONNECT (like 200).
#	DREADERD MAKES A CONNECTION TO EACH SERVER FOR EVERY FORK!!! 
#	Additionally, if you have configured dreaderd to use the diablo server
#	for both posting and spool access, the number of connections will
#	double.  Be careful in regards to running the diablo server out of
#	file descriptors!
#
maxconnect	15

# remember N
#
#	Specify the history retention for diablo.  If not specified here,
#	the compiled default (14) is used.  This parameter will override the
#	compiled default for both the diablo binary and the didump binary's
#	-x option.
#
#	The value indicates the minimum time that records of articles
#	are kept in history, even if deleted from the spool. Articles still
#	on spool will always exist in history, but articles expired from
#	the spool after this number of delays will be removed from history
#	immediately. This is to help prevent duplicate articles being offered
#	by peers.
#
#	Note that history entries for articles still in the spool (as 
#	determined by dexpire) are not deleted even if they are older then 
#	the remember time.  
#
#	This parameter also specifies the oldest article that Diablo
#	will accept on an incoming newsfeed. See also feedermaxacceptage.
#
#	See "Caution:" in 'feedermaxacceptage' below.
#	
#remember 15
#remember 7
#remember 3

#feedermaxacceptage N
#	Specify the maximum age for received articles before they are
#	rejected (in days). A 's', 'm', 'h' or 'd' can be appended to
#	the value to indicate seconds, minutes, hours or days respectively.
#	The default is 14 days.
#
#	Caution: Diablo does not examine the time zone offset for an
#	article when deciding if that article is too old or too far into
#	the future to be accepted.  Because of this, setting
#	"feedermaxacceptage" to 1 (expecting a maximum age of one
#	day/24 hours) will cause cause some articles posted in the past
#	24 hours with non local time zone indicators to be falsely rejected
#	as being too old, even if posted seconds before reception and with
#	correct clock settings at article sender and receiver.
#
#	This behavior of "feedermaxacceptage" is not that obvious, and so
#	this setting should be considered to be establishing the absolute
#	maximum article age that will be accepted, with the minumum age
#	article that could be considered to be "too old" always being
#	24 hours less than the setting, minus your local offset to GMT.
#
#	For example, if you want to accept all articles that are up to seven
#	days old that are posted with any time zone offset, set
#	"feedermaxacceptage" #  to 8.  The system will then accept *certain*
#	articles that are dated between 7.0001 and 7.9999 days older than the
#	specified 8 value and 100% of articles dated between 0 to 7.0000 days.
#
#	Note that the value of 'remember' is used as the default for this value
#       and this value will only override 'remember' if placed later
#	in this file.
#
# feedermaxacceptage 10h
# feedermaxacceptage 14

# hostcacherebuildtime n
#	Specify the time (in seconds) between rebuilds of the diablo.hosts
#       host IP address cache. This cache file is used to improve the
#       performance of new connections and to minimise DNS lookups.
#	The default of every hour is probably more than sufficient
#       to catch changes to the DNS. The file is also rebuilt within a
#       minute of diablo.hosts being modified.
#
#hostcacherebuildtime 3600

# precommittime n
#	Set the amount of time (in seconds) that entries are considered
#	valid in the precommit cache (cache of message-id's currently
#	being offered to us). The default is 30 seconds. A value of
#	0 disables the cache and negative values are ignored.
#precommittime 30

# postcommittime n
#	Set the amount of time (in seconds) that entries are considered
#	valid in the postcommit cache (history cache). The default is
#	45 minutes (2700 sec). A value of 0 disables the cache and
#	negative values are ignored. Note that cache slots can be
#	reused within this time, so it is only a maximum value.
#postcommittime 2700

# hiscachesize n
#	Set the number of slots available in the history cache. The
#	actual memory used is this value x the size of the history
#	cache structure (currrently 16 bytes).
#	IMPORTANT: This value needs to be a power of 2. e.g: 8192,
#		   16384, 32768, 65536, 131072
#hiscachesize 16384

# feederhostname hostname
#	Set the hostname of this host. This value is used to set the
#	defaults for other host options (pathhost, xref, etc) and
#	defaults to the value obtained by the gethostname() call.
#	
# feederhostname host.example.com

# feederbindport port
#	Set the TCP port to listen for connections. Defaults to the
#	NNTP port of 119.
feederbindport 119

# feederbindhost hostname/ip
#	Only listen on a specific interface specified as a hostname or
#	IP address. Default is all interfaces.
# feederbindhost

# internalfilter n
#	Enable the internal spamfilter. IMPORTANT: There must also be
#	an ISPAM entry in dnewsfeeds before any articles will reach the
#	filter even if it is enabled here. The ISPAM entry determines
#	which articles are sent to the internal filter.
#
#	There are two internal filters available:
#	  Duplicate body detection
#	  NNTP-Posting-Host rate detection
#	Each type is enabled with a different option, which also sets
#	the trip value for that type.
#	  Bnnn - enables duplicate body detection and sets the number
#		of allowed duplicates before further articles are rejected.
#	  Nnnn - enables the NNTP-Posting-Host rate detection and the
#		number specifies how many duplicate hosts are allowed
#		in an hour before extra articles from that host are
#		rejected.
#	  ennn - set the expire time (in seconds) for the previous
#		'B' or 'N' option. Default is 3600 (1 hour).
#	  snnn - set the number of entries in the filter hash table to
#		nnn for the previous 'B' or 'N' option. The size must be
#		a power of 2. Default is 65536 entries.
#
#	Both types of filters also make a note of the number of lines in
#	the body of the article to reduce the possibility of false
#	duplicates.
#
#	Use of this option causes the creation of 2 files in path_db
#	that are used to store the filter hash tables.
#
#	e.g: B6s32768 N16t7200 would set the body filter trip to 6, with
#	a hash table size of 32768 entries and the nph filter trip to 16
#	with the default hash table size of 65536 and keeps track of
#	entries for 2 hours.
#
#	The default is disabled (B0 N0).
#
# internalfilter B6 N16

# feederfilter /filterpath
#	Set the path to and enable the external spamfilter.
#	Note that there must also be an ESPAM entry in dnewsfeeds
#	which determines which articles are sent to the filter and
#	the dnewsfeed labels for feeds will need 'nospam' directives
#	to prevent the feed from receiving spam.
#	By default, this option is disabled and no articles are sent
#	to the external spamfilter.
#
# feederfilter /news/dbin/filter/spamfilter

# rejectartswithnul on/off
#	Enable/disable the rejection of articles that contain a NUL
#	character. Default is off.
# rejectartswithnul off

# rejectartswithbarecr on/off
#	Enable/disable the rejection of articles that contain a CR that
#	is not part of a CRLF pair. These articles sometimes cause problems
#	for dnewslink when feeding to other server software. Default is off.
# rejectartswithbarecr off

# feederpath hostname
#	Set the pathhost value added to all articles accepted by the
#	feeder. The pathhost is added when the article is received.
#	Defaults to the feederhostname. A value of '0' will disable
#	the addition of the hostname to the Path: header, but this
#	use is discouraged as it can cause loops if not used carefully.
#	Multiple uses of this option can be used and will be added
#	to the header in the order in which they appear in this file.
#	See also the commonpath option, which is included in the oder
#	calculation.
#
# feederpath host.example.com

# commonpath
#	Add this to the Path: header if it doesn't already exist there.
#	Multiple uses of this option can be used and will be added
#	to the header in the order in which they appear in this file.
#	See also the feederpath option, which is included in the oder
#	calculation.  This defaults to blank.
#
# commonpath host.example.com

# feederautoaddtoactive on/off
#	Automatically add all newsgroups in the Newsgroup: header that don't
#	exist in the feeder's active file. Default is off.
#
#	Note that it won't get a group description (GD), moderator address
#	(M), or moderation flag (S) set, which is almost certainly
#	something you'll have to cobble together yourself at a later date.
#
#	You probably do NOT want to set this on any normal newsserver
#
# feederautoaddtoactive off

# feederrtstats none/label/hostname
#	Keep realtime statistics of incoming and outgoing feeds by
#	label or hostname. The default is by label and 'none' disabled
#	the collection of realtime feed stats.
#
#	The stats are stored in a file specified by path_feedstats
#	and are retrieved using dfeedinfo. The file is only created
#	when the first connection is made (incoming or outgoing). The
#	stats are persisent across reboots and only ever reset when
#	when done manually by deleting the file or using dfeedinfo -z.
#
# feederrtstats label

# feederbuffersize value
#	Set the starting size of the incoming article buffer. This
#	buffer is allocated each time an article comes in and increasing
#	this has slight benefits when receiving large binaries.
#	The higher this value, the more memory the diablo processes use.
#	The default value is 1, which means use the pagesize for the
#	OS (generally 4096 bytes). The pagesize is the minimum value.
#	A value of '32k' may be useful.
#
# feederbuffersize 1

# feedermaxartsize n
#	Set the maximum incoming article size accepted by diablo.
#	This is a good way to restrict the size of buffers used for
#	incoming articles. Without this option, a very large article
#	could use a lot of memory. This option doesn't save bandwidth
#	as the article is still received; it just isn't stored anywhere.
#	The default is 1000000. A value of 0 allows any article size.

# feedermaxartsize 10000000

# wireformat	on/off
#	This option causes all articles to be stored on the spool in
#	the format they are received from the remote host. i.e: They
#	include the '\r' and initial line '.'s are not decoded. The
#	article is also stored with the trailing '.\r\n'. This causes
#	a little more disk space to be used to gain performance in
#	sending articles out (CPU saving).
#
# wireformat	off

# feederarttypes on/off
#	This option allows the article type detection code to be
#	disabled. This can have a slight performance improvement on
#	feeders that don't use any form of article type decisions.
#	Default: on
#
# feederarttypes on

# feederpreloadart on/off
# spoolpreloadart on/off
#	These options enable/disable an option to the loading of
#	articles via mmap() that cause the articles to be preloaded
#	thus potentially decreasing the number of seeks and disk
#	activity at the expense of memory.  Not all operating systems
#	support the MADV_WILLNEED option to madvise() used by this
#	option and hence it will be disabled on them. feederpreloadart
#	applies to dnewslink and spoolpreloadart applies to retrieval
#	of articles from a diablo spool.
#	Default: on (if available)
#
# feederpreloadart on
# spoolpreloadart on

# feedermaxheadersize	n
#	Set the maximum size of headers that we are willing to
#	accept for feeder (in bytes). A size of zero
#	disables the check. The default value is 64K.
#
# feedermaxheadersize	64k

#									#
#			DIABLO READER OPTIONS				#
#									#
#########################################################################

# readerforks	10
# readerthreads 40
# readerdns	5
# readerfeedforks 2
#
#	Specify the number of reader processes (forks), and number of
#	threads per process.  A thread limitation exists dependant on
#	the number of descriptors your system supports, one descriptor
#	is required per thread.  Also specify the number of DNS reverser
#	processes.
#
#	A fork limitation exists in that each reader fork will open up all
#	server connections (/news/dserver.hosts), eating a base number of
#	descriptors for fork. 
#
#	The default is 10 forks, 40 threads = 400 online readers.  You can
#	up these values considerably.  for example, 25 forks and 40 threads
#	would support 1000 simultanious readers.
#
#	WARNING!  Each fork connects to all spool/reader servers, so make sure
#	they can handle it.  For example, if connecting to a diablo spool or 
#	feed you must set 'maxconnect' to at least the number of readerforks!!!
#	It may be better to do 10 forks and 40 threads, for example.  Watch out
#	for your file descriptor usage... I do not suggest more then 64 threads
#	per fork.  If you experience excessive latency, try increasing the
#	number of forks and decreasing the number of threads per fork.
#
#	The readerfeedfork option specified the number of dedicated
#	feed-only processes are created. Feed-only processes have a slight
#	performance improvement for incoming header feeds over connections
#	shared with reader processes.

# readercache	on
#
#	Specify whether dreaderd tries to cache articles in /news/spool/cache/
#	or not.  The default is on.
#
#	You must periodically remove files from the cache from cron.  You can
#	remove any file at any time.  Please see the sample cron jobs.  YOU
#	ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING FREE SPACE IN THE CACHE DIRECTORY.
#	Dreaderd will not die if it runs out of space in the cache but it will
#	become more inefficient.
#
#	You should turn off the readercache if you are running the diablo feeder
#	on the same machine.  Use dserver.hosts to make the feeder the first 
#	level cache for the reader.

# readercachehashsize 2048
#
#	set the number of entries for the hash of the scoring cache.
#	default to 4096

# readerxover	on/trackonly
#
#	Default is on.  Specify how the reader is to maintain its xover 
#	information.  If "on" the reader maintains the article numbering
#	control information used by expireover to maintain the active file
#	AND the reader stores the article headers.  This is required for
#	normal reader operation where a user connects in with a newsreader
#	client.
#
#	If you are using the reader *just* so you can maintain the active 
#	file's article numbering and run expireover then you can set this
#	to 'trackonly' which causes the control information to be stored but
#	the headers not to be stored.  'trackonly' mode is often used when
#	you want to setup one machine to master and maintain the spool and
#	active file, and have other machines deal with the user readers.

# readercrash	none
# readercrash	/news/bin/dreaderd-crash-handler
#
#	This specifies the program to run if dreaderd crashes. In case of
#	a SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, etc, dreaderd will fork, and run this program,
#	passing the forked PID as the only argument. Since dreaderd cannot
#	dump core, this is an alternative way of preserving crash state;
#	if the handler notifies the maintainers, they can later attach to
#	the crashed process and examine what happened.
#
#	Default is "none", which preserves the old behavior of chewing all
#	spare CPU cycles at high niceness, if dreaderd is ran with -X. If
#	a value other than none is specified, -X is not necessary.

# readerhostname hostname
#	Set the hostname of this host. This value is used to set the
#	defaults for other host options (pathhost, xref, etc) and
#	defaults to the value obtained by the gethostname() call.
#	
# readerhostname host.example.com

# readerbindport port
#	Set the TCP port to listen for connections. Defaults to the
#	NNTP port of 119.
readerbindport 119

# readerbindhost hostname/ip
#	Only listen on a specific interface specified as a hostname or
#	IP address. Default is all interfaces.
# readerbindhost

# readerxrefhost hostname
#	Specify the Xref: hostname to be used when displaying Xref: lines
#	This defaults to the pathhost and can be overrriden we per
#	connection using options in dreader.access
#
# readerxrefhost host.example.com

# readerxrefslavehost hostname
#	Specify the Xref: hostname that must match incoming articles
#	before they are accepted into the header database. Articles
#	with an Xref: hostname that doesn't match this option will
#	be dropped. This option must be specified if the reader is
#	running in Xref slave mode. If it and the '-x' command-line
#	option are not specified, dreaderd will ignore Xref: lines
#	of incoming articles and generate its own.
#
# readerxrefslavehost host.example.com

# readerpath hostname
#	Set the value added as the first (most recent) entry in the
#	Path: header when sending articles to clients.
#	This defaults to the pathhost and can be overrriden we per
#	connection using options in dreader.access
#
# readerpath host.example.com

# readerautoaddtoactive on/off
#	Automatically add all newsgroups in the Newsgroup: header that don't
#	exist in the reader's active file. This includes local postings.
#	Default is off.
#
#	Note that it won't get a group description (GD), moderator address
#	(M), or moderation flag (S) set, which is almost certainly
#	something you'll have to cobble together yourself at a later date.
#
#	You probably do NOT want to set this on any normal newsserver
#
# readerautoaddtoactive off

# readerdetaillog on/off
#	Log detailed debugging information about incoming and outgoing
#	commands via syslog. Default is on.
#
#	This can also be configured in dreader.access with the "logcmd"
#	command on a per-reader basis.

# readerdetaillog on

# readercachedirs N[/N]...
#	Set the number of reader cache directory levels and directories
#	per level to create. Up to 9 levels of N directories can be
#	specified. Directories are created automatically if they don't
#	exist and are made from a hex value of the hash of the cache
#	file name. At least 2 levels of directories is a good option.
#	The default (backward compatable) is a single level of 512
#	directories.
#	IMPORTANT: If this option is changed, the cache spool MUST be
#	deleted to prevent incorrect articles being sent to clients.

# readercachedirs 512

# readergrouphash crc           (default)
# readergrouphash md5-32[:B]/N[/N]

# readergrouphash md5-64[:B]/N[/N]
# readergrouphash md5-64[:B]\N[\N]
# readergrouphash hierarchy

#	Set the hash method used for newsgroup header index and data
#	filenames.
#	crc is the old (and default) method, but has been found to have
#	duplicate hashes for groups with very similar names.
#	md5-32 is a 32 bit base64 conversion of an md5 hash of the group name.
#	md5-64 is a base64 type conversion of an md5 hash of the group name,
#	  The backslash ('\') followed by the number of characters represents
#	  the number of characters of the hash (from the start) to use for the
#	  directory name (max 9). A 2nd level of directories is optional 
#	  and the characters after the 1st level are used.
#	  The forwardslash ('/') followed by a number represents the number
#	  of directories to create at that level.
#	  See lib/hash.c for a more comprehensive description of the
#	  directories and structure.
#	hierarchy uses the newsgroup hierarchy for the path and the full
#	newsgroup name for the filename. This option is not recommended
#	for large servers as it can lead to very unbalanced directory
#	sizes and hence performance problems.
#
#	Once a method is chosen you can only switch to another with the
#	server down and by running 'doverctl'. Also ensure that dexpireover
#	does not run during the conversion.
#
#	md5-32/128/128 is recommended for an average full feed server on
#	an array of disks. This seems to give an average spread of groups
#	over 16384 directories.

#	Enable the use of a ban list for abusive reader connections.
#	NOTE: This option needs to be enabled at compile-time (lib/vendor.h)
#	This option works by counting the connections that exceed the
#	limits for the specified category of connection and once exceeded
#	further connections from that user/host are rejected until the
#	specified timeout. Any connections attempts during the banned
#	period, reset the timer from the start.
#	The options are:
#		U	following options are for authenticated users
#			(maxconnperuser)
#		H	following options are for hosts (maxconnperhost)
#		G	following options are for groups (maxconnpergroup)
#		L	following options are global (connections exceeding
#			the server limits.
#		s	set the hash size (default is 64 entries)
#		l	set the length of the hash links (default 8)
#		c	set the number of connection attempts before
#			the user/host is banned
#		t	set the amount of time (in seconds) for which
#			the user/host is banned
#	Spaces are not permitted. The lower case letters apply to
#	the type of connections specified by the capital letter prior
#	to it in the list. e.g:
#		Hc10t3600Uc10t7200
#	means that any host that exceeds the maxconnperhost more than 10
#	times, will have connections rejected for the next hour. Users
#	will be rejected for the next 2 hours.
#	This option is not really suitable for general news server use,
#	but can be useful for servers that are often abused by users
#	trying to exceed the access configured limits.
#	The default is no banning.

# readermaxartsize n
#	Set the maximum incoming article size accepted by dreaderd
#	via a local POST or incoming header feed.
#	This is a good way to restrict the size of buffers used for
#	incoming articles. Without this option, a very large article
#	could use a lot of memory. This option doesn't save bandwidth
#	as the article is still received; it just isn't stored anywhere.
#	The default is 1000000. A value of 0 allows any article size.

# readermaxartsize 10000000

# pgpverifyargs	string
#	Set the arguments to pgpverify. This is usually the path and
#	arguments used to run pgp or gpg
#	PGP 2.6.1i: /usr/local/bin/pgp -f
#	GPG : /usr/local/bin/gpgv

# pgpverifyargs /usr/local/bin/pgp -f

# readeridenttimeout n
#	Set the default timeout for ident requests (if used)
#	There is also an override that can be used when
#	specifying a specific authdef in dreader.access

# readeridenttimeout 10
