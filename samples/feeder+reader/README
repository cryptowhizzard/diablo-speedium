This is a very basic set of example files for running a feeder and
reader on the same machine. The sample files assume the reader is
running on port 119 and the feeder on port 120. Both could run
on the same port if they are bound to different interfaces, in
which case, make sure that dserver.hosts connects to the
correct hostname.

Note that incoming feeds to the feeder will need to connect to
port 120, instead of port 119.
